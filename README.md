# testing-practice

Practicing unit testing using Jest. Tests for the following functions:

A `capitalize` function that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized.

A `reverseString` function that takes a string and returns it reversed.

A `calculator` object that contains functions for the basic operations: `add`, `subtract`, `divide`, and `multiply`. Each of these functions should take two numbers and return the correct calculation.

A `caesarCipher` function that takes a string and returns it with each character “shifted”.
